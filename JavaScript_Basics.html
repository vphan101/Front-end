            <h2>JavaScripts Basics</h2>
            <h3>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety reasons.
                It is a small and it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control  over them lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers 
                to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host.</h3>

                <ul id="nav-main">
                    <li><a href="Variable.Declaration">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must identified with unique names. These names are called identifiers.<span> var x;</span></li>
                
                    <li><a href="Variable.Assignment">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables- our cup can now have coffee poured it in, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span> var x = 10;</span></li>
                
                    <li><a href="Data.Types">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitive: Boolean -<span> true</span> or <span> false;</span> null - <span> null</span> aka nothing: Number - <span> 42</span> or <span> 3.14159;</span> String - <span> "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - 
                    <span> [1,'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span> {first_name: 'Jane',clast_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
                
                    <li><a href="Conditionals">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on 
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the folowing
                    conditional statements: <span> if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span> else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                    condition is false; <span> else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>

                    <li><a href="Loops">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop.
                    </li>

                    <li><a href="Function">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instrution manual and get started, first we
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                    tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
